The analysis is on a Amazon product network where products linked if brought together. The Amazon network contains multiple node types: products, product category membership, and reviewers. Our scope will focus on the sub-network of amazon products in the toy category.\n",

Reviewers with a high helpful review count may give a product a rating closest to the overall rating. Our findings will help us understand how product reviews reflect its status in the toy network."

The workarounds are the selection of certain toy products and/or a network of a certain radius length. The other concern is the reviewer's truthfulness in the reviews as there is no way for verification. We will have to take the information supplied at face value than a text analysis on the specific review itself.\n"
